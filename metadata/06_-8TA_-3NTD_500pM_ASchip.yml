setup:
    excitation_alternated: [False, True]
    excitation_input_powers: [0.5, 0.8]

sample:
    sample_name: -8TA_-3NTD_500pM_ASchip
    dye_names: ATTO550, ATTO647N
    buffer_name: TE50

description: >
    dually labeled dsLACONS promotor DNA
    
    control measurement for this sample is 05 where the same sample was measured
    without the chip at the same powers, without gasket.
    
    total sample volume = 37 uL 
    10 uL/hr input flow rate
    
    background is much higher with PDMS chip but can detect bursts at this flow rate!!
