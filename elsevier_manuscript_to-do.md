1. line 329 disscuses pulsed laser 68 MHz: where does this number come from?

2. Where do these numbers come from? Is pm picometers??
    - donor channel: $531\pm 918 Hz$, acceptor channel: $577\pm 1,261 Hz$)~\cite{ingargiola_JCP_2018}

3. line 666: dark count is not due to either of these already mentioned in the list?

4. 691: how would synchronization be implemented? TCSPC, or is that an addition?

5. 706: an additional board is used in the PAX setup that has a base clock that syncronizes with the AOM (PXI-6602). Is this not the FPGA board? Which is it....?

6. 1192:  how does Xavier calculate this? 
- using chip dimentions and flow rate (10uL/hr)
